# codingquiz

The assignment was to create a quiz which included a timer, high score log, and a penalty component added to the timer when an incorrect answer was submitted. 

I felt extremely challenged by this assignment, and was not able to complete all the criteria. Some of the issues that need resolving:

localStorage of player's name/initials and then displaying that string on a page;

Ability for player to clear high scores;

Ability for player to return to landing page after clicking "no" button at end of game.
